# graphQl
This is the basic graphql example and some notes about graphql

**Notes:** Simply graphQl is used for fetching the specific Data from the bunch of data

**Senario:** If we have a collection of college data. We store the data in the database using different tables, not in the same. Consider that there are multiple departments and different teachers for each department. We are storing the department and teacher table separately. 
And these are connected.
Consider that we are fetching all the teacher's list and that data includes the department id. When we fetch the list and again loop the data to find the department of each teacher. For large data it causes network traffic problems. Because of that  Facebook developed the graphQl concept.


**What is GRAPHQL **

 1) GraphQL is a language designed for client applications to fetch the exact data needed from an API.
 2) GraphQL allows client applications to describe the type and shape of data required from a backend API
 3) GraphQL enables client applications to call a single endpoint for any type of request.
 4) GraphQL is like SQL, but for the front end.
 
**Difference between the Rest API and GraphQl**

Rest has been the most popular architecture style for making APIs. but in the recent years, GraphQlâ€™ popularity has comes.

REST and GraphQl are two methods used to Retrieve data. One is more traditional and other is just come out in 2015

**HISTORY of Apis.**


The first api started to appear in 2000 . it was created by Big companies like salesforce and ebay

GraphQl and rest are two Api design approaches that fulfill the same functions: data transmission via internet protocols such as HTTP, However,how they do so varies significantly.Graphql is a query language,where as rest is an architecture
